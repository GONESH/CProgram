/*
Twenty integers are stored in memory.
What will you pefer - Array or Structures
*/
//We use stucture when we have collection of dissimilar elements
//We use Array when we have collection of similar elements
/*
It depends on the specific use case and requirements.

If you need to store and manipulate a collection of related data items of the same type, 
then an array would be a better choice. 
An array provides a convenient way to store and access a collection of data items of the same type using a single identifier. 
For example, if you need to store and manipulate the marks of 20 students, then an array of integers would be a good choice.

On the other hand, if you need to store and manipulate a collection of related data items of different types, 
then a structure would be a better choice. A structure allows you to group together a collection of data items of different types under a single name. 
For example, if you need to store and manipulate the name, age, and salary of an employee, then a structure with three members 
(char array for name, integer for age, and float for salary) would be a good choice.

In the case of storing twenty integers, an array would be a better choice since all the data items are of the same type (integers). 
However, if you need to store additional information related to each integer, such as a description or a label, 
then a structure with two members (integer for the value and char array for the description) would be a better choice.

In summary, the choice between an array and a structure depends on the specific use case and requirements. 
If you need to store and manipulate a collection of related data items of the same type, then an array would be a better choice. 
If you need to store and manipulate a collection of related data items of different types, then a structure would be a better choice.

/*
So considering above point we would store in array if the elemnts are similar , and if it is disimilar then structures are essentials

When 20 integers are store then it will be collection of similar elements- so Array will be the correct answers
